By default messages will be deleted from SQS after they are retrieved. Enable this setting if you would like messages to not
be removed from SQS after retrieval. Your job configuration will probably want to remove these messages or they will be 
retrieved again after the visibility timeout passes. 
<p/>
The goal is to prevent messages from going unprocessed when something crashes before the Jenkins job completes.
