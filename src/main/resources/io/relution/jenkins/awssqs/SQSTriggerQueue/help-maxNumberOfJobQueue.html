<div>
The maximum number of buildable items in the build job queue before pausing the retrieval of SQS messages.
Values can be from 0 (don't pull messages from SQS when there is a build job queue) to 100,000. Default is 1000. Pause set to  
15 seconds.
<p/>
The goal is to prevent overloading a busy Jenkins master that has a build queue with additional work.
